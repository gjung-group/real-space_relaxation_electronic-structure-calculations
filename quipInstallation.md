To install the quip machine learning potential with Lammps, a couple of notes:
- Install quip first, do not forget to activate the GAP library while doing so. Details here. https://libatoms.github.io/GAP/installation.html. Important, use gfortran compiler. Check the lammps specific section to turn quip into a library.
- Install LAMMPS from source as usual, but add the path to the quip library you have just created. 
```
cmake -D PKG_MANYBODY=yes -D PKG_USER-MISC=yes -D PKG_MOLECULE=yes -D PKG_USER-QUIP=yes -D QUIP_LIBRARY=/home/nleconte/github/QUIP/build/linux_x86_64_gfortran/libquip.a  ../cmake
```
Do not mix yes, on, etc within cmake. gfortran should be your standard compiler chosen by cmake, do not change it, otherwise youâ€™ll have trouble interfacing with quip. In case you really need it, you need to activate it with the following 
```
-D -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpiicpc -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpiifort
```
but you might have to recompile quip with a different compiler. Unfortunately, several attemps at quip compilation using intel compiler failed for me (both icc and gcc).
- To run the calculation, e.g. using drip for interlayer interactions, and tersoff for B N interactions:
```
 pair_style hybrid/overlay drip quip extep
 pair_coeff * * drip  C.drip   B N C
 pair_coeff * * quip  Carbon_GAP_20_potential/Carbon_GAP_20.xml "" NULL NULL 6
 pair_coeff  * * extep BN.extep  B  N NULL # chemical
 ```
- The Carbon_GAP_20_potential folder, I have a local copy. The usual open database is not available these days, but you can download it from https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.54529.
